# QImp
QImp is the experimental implementation of an interpreter for the quantum programming language Qumin.
For more info, check out the (still under-construction) [tutorial](https://wintershammer.github.io)
 over at my github page!


# Installing and running programs in Qumin:

Qumin is written in Python 3, so the latest version of the Python 3 interpreter must be installed in your computer.
It also has the following dependencies:
* Parsimonious 
* NumPy
* SciPy
which can be installed via tools like `pip`.

Running programs is done by executing the `run()` function of `mini.py` with the name of the file that contains the classical fragment of your program as the argument.
